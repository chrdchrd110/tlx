# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming challenges from TLX TOKI platform.

## Solutions List

1. **File5.cpp** - Finding minimum difference between rows and columns that multiply to N
2. **File8.cpp** - Pattern printing with cyclic numbers
3. **File9.cpp** - Matrix multiplication implementation
4. **File10.cpp** - Finding minimum and maximum Manhattan distances between points
5. **File11.cpp** - String manipulation - removing substrings
   Etc...

## Problem Statements

Each solution corresponds to a specific problem from TLX TOKI. Problems include:

- Mathematical computations
- Pattern generation
- Matrix operations
- Geometric calculations
- String operations

## Implementation Details

Solutions are implemented in C++ and focus on:

- Efficient algorithms
- Proper input validation
- Error handling
- Memory management

## Running the Solutions

To compile and run any solution:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 filename.cpp -o filename
./filename
```

Make sure you have MinGW C++ compiler installed on your machine

## Notes

- Most solutions pass the TLX TOKI test cases
- Code includes comments for better understanding
- Input validation is implemented for robustness
